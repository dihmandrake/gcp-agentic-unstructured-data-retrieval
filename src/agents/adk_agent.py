# TODO: HACKATHON CHALLENGE (Challenge 2, Part 1)
# The prompt below is static. Your goal is to implement a prompt router
# that dynamically selects a persona and instructions based on the user's query.
# For example, a query asking for a summary might use a "summarizer" persona,
# while a query asking for specific data points might use a "data extractor" persona.
# You can define different prompt strategies in a new module and then
# modify this agent to use a router to select one before executing the search.
